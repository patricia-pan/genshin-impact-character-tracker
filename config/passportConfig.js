// Constructor's (new LocalStrategy) FIRST ARGUMENT: (fieldsToCheck) is an object that indicates how we'll be referring to the two fields we're checking for, where we check for email instead of username.
// SECOND ARGUMENT: A callback that is ready to receive the two fields we're checking, as well as a doneCallback.
